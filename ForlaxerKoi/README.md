# ForlaxerKoi

ForlaxerKoi was made to save time, it does everything for you by just drag n dropping the exes.
Basically it detects the obfuscators and replace the invoke with the customizable one. Also for koiVM it takes the #Koi section and write it into a resource called 'VM' so you wont have to bother about it anymore

2 Modes are available: 

-DBG & BNG: logs the invokes data in forlaxerTracer.txt and read if there is anything to replace from the json config file.
-BNG: Doesnt generate the tracers so you would use this is if you planning to release your reversed app.
