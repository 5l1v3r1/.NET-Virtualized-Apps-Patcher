# .NET-Virtualized-Apps-Patcher

This is a universal Patcher that I coded for Virtualized Applications. Protected by KoiVM/EazVM/AgileVM.
The project idea wasnt mine at all it was by xsilent and Tobito and they released a txt that contains the tracer, uh I asked time for some infos and ended up coding my version.

I'm sorry for both of em, as this projects wasnt suposed to be released until they drop their version (which is better and more advanced than mine). But due to some issues and 'leaks' that occured by a mistake I though it would be better to release it before someone do and claims it his project. This is my version of their idea. Hope you both understand guys and sorry again.


I fully coded this with the help of these 2 awesome guys:
